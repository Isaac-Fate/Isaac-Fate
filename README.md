Currently, I am pursuing the degree of Master of Data Science at the University of Hong Kong, where I have honed my skills in data analysis and machine learning techniques. 
Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), solidifying my foundation in mathematical principles.

My research interests revolve around the application of LLMs and their fine-tuning, particularly in the context of prompt engineering. I am also intrigued by the integration of machine learning, deep learning, and statistical analysis into software engineering, with a focus on stabilizing AI-driven outputs for production use.

My educational background has equipped me with a strong understanding of mathematics, which serves as the backbone of my academic pursuits. 

In terms of practical experiences, I have had the privilege of developing several app demos for external companies leveraging LLMs (Large Language Models). These demos include chatbots with local knowledge bases and automated resume generation. Additionally, I have actively engaged in self-learning Rust to enhance my software development skills and enable the creation of customized features.

During my internship at FOSUN company, I contributed to the data-driven non-invasive glucose monitoring project, utilizing machine learning methods to drive advancements in healthcare. This experience further solidified my expertise in machine learning and deep learning techniques.

In my spare time, I continuously review mathematics and document my findings in comprehensive notebooks. This practice not only reinforces my understanding but also demonstrates my commitment to continuous learning and knowledge dissemination.


## Production Projects

- Assistant AI for Sales Support: A chatbot designed to assist sales officers within an educational organization. It aids in responding to inquiries from students' parents, providing timely and accurate information.
- Automated Resume Generation: A web application designed to streamline the process of resume creation. It generates and refines resumes automatically, using basic user information provided as input.

## Personal Projects

- [LLM Chatbot Equipped with Domain-Specific Knowledge](https://github.com/Isaac-Fate/my-chat): A LLM chatbot that leverages document and vector databases. 
Users can also configure the chatbot's profile to elicit more tailored responses.
- [Deep Dream](https://github.com/Isaac-Fate/deep-dream): A PyTorch implementation of the well-known Deep Dream project, which can decorate a target image in a specified style using transfer learning. 
- [`xpyutils`](https://pypi.org/project/xpyutils/): A simple Python helper package that includes the implementation of lazy properties, singletons, etc.

## Mathematics Notebooks

I meticulously review and organize mathematical content, integrating my own understanding into the material. I then compile these insights into easy-to-digest notebooks, making the content more accessible and comprehensible.

Below are the mathematics notebooks I am currently composing:

- [Mathematical Analysis](https://isaac-fate.github.io/mathematical-analysis/intro.html)
- [Linear Algebra](https://isaac-fate.github.io/linear-algebra/intro.html)
- [Probability Theory](https://isaac-fate.github.io/probability-theory/intro.html)
- [Graph Theory](https://isaac-fate.github.io/graph-theory/intro.html)

## Course Projects

- Smartphone App on IOS: A highly customizable mobile application designed for iOS devices using SwfitUI. It offers a feature-rich platform for tracking expenses across various categories, providing a personalized accounting experience.
- [Stock Price Prediction](https://isaac-fate.github.io/stox/intro.html): A tempt of predicting stock prices using LSTM with elementary NLP analysis of the daily news.
